# HBR Reading Logs on Generative AI, Markets, and Customer Research

This repository documents my ongoing reading and reflection practice on generative AI and its evolving role in markets, organizations, and customer behavior.

I am particularly interested in how generative AI is developing—not only as a technology, but as a system that reshapes how firms communicate, how consumers make decisions, and how identities and “personas” are constructed through AI-mediated interactions.

This project is exploratory by design. Rather than committing to a fixed research theme, I use regular reading and writing as a way to clarify what genuinely captures my interest. My goal is to read at least one substantive article per week and produce a structured reflection that moves beyond summary toward interpretation and questioning.

Across readings, I often find myself returning to questions such as:

- How does generative AI shape or simulate human personas?  
- How does AI alter marketing communication and customer research?  
- When does AI augment human judgment, and when does it substitute for it?  
- How do firms experiment with and scale generative AI?  
- How does AI influence how customers search, evaluate, and choose?  

Some reflections focus more on organizational implementation. Others focus on customer behavior, brand perception, or AI-human interaction. Over time, patterns across these notes may suggest a clearer research direction.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves three purposes:

1. To cultivate a disciplined intellectual routine  
2. To practice writing analytically about emerging technologies  
3. To clarify and refine my developing research interests in generative AI, marketing, and customer research  

This is not a blog. It is a structured reading log intended to track evolving thinking over time.
