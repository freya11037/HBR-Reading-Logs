# Scaling Sales with AI: Execution Over Hype

SAP’s use of AI to reach small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is compelling not because it showcases cutting-edge models, but because it shows what happens when a large organization actually redesigns its commercial process around AI. The case is less about experimentation and more about disciplined execution.

SAP maps the SME journey into five stages—Discover, Select, Adopt, Derive, and Extend—and layers more than 40 AI tools across this pipeline. Digital Hubs now conduct roughly 90% of the buying journey virtually. Sales cycles that once lasted 12–18 months have been reduced to 3–6 months. Prospecting time drops by nearly 40%. Task completion time falls by more than 60% in pilot stages. The conversion rate does not dramatically change; what changes is speed and cost-to-serve.

For me, the most important lesson is that “AI strategy” is almost a misnomer. This is sales-process strategy with AI as an enabler. SAP did not begin with a fascination for generative models. It began with a structural constraint: traditional enterprise sales were too expensive and too slow for SMEs. AI became the mechanism that re-priced access to this segment and expanded total addressable market. The transformation lies in economic viability, not in model sophistication.

What’s harder to miss is the execution burden behind this story. SAP developed more than 1,250 documented GPT prompts. It ran large internal innovation challenges. It piloted hundreds of ideas before scaling. It built a platform to integrate internal and third-party tools. It had to resolve CRM integration issues and manage cultural resistance inside a federated organization. None of this is glamorous. But it is the real work of institutionalizing AI.

The article, however, leaves one dimension underexplored: the human side. When 90% of the pipeline is AI-assisted, what happens to the sales role? My hunch is that the skill mix shifts. Repetitive prospecting and customization tasks are automated, while human reps move toward exception handling, negotiation, and orchestration of digital assets. That could increase the importance of strategic and relational skills, even as routine creative work declines. It may also compress performance differences between average and top performers, since AI standardizes outreach quality. The case hints at role evolution but does not follow it through.

Overall, this example reads to me less as a story about generative brilliance and more as one about operational compression. AI takes over the repetitive, low-value parts of the sales process so humans can focus on complex conversations. The hard part is not access to models; it is redesigning workflows, incentives, and governance around them. SAP’s experience suggests that the real advantage of AI lies in disciplined integration rather than technological novelty.


### Emerging Questions

- If 90% of the sales pipeline is AI-assisted, what does day-to-day work actually look like for employees? Do they feel empowered by the tools, or does their role become narrower and more constrained?

- Is this truly a generative AI transformation, or primarily a digital efficiency upgrade at scale? In other words, what would have to change for this to move beyond faster execution into somethin
